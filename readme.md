# Welcome to Cheeze Wizards

Cheeze Wizards is the world's first blockchain battle royale (with cheese)

One of blockchain’s best qualities is the freedom for anyone to build on top of their favorite dapps––all without having to ask for parmesan!

We tried to make everything easy so you can build  awesome things on top
